What does the federal government do in crop insurance and why?
* Insures crop, multi-peril, hail
* Because the government would rather administer an insurance program than use FEMA disaster relief funds

What's the difference between a Direct Servicing Agent (DSA) and a Write-Your-Own (WYO) Program for the NFIP
* DSA is private contractor for FEMA
* WYO is written privately, but with 100% government reinsurance and reimburses administration expenses
