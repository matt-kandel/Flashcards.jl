What does the federal government do in crop insurance and why?
* Reinsures crop, multi-peril, hail
* Because the government would rather administer an insurance program than use FEMA disaster relief funds

What's the difference between a Direct Servicing Agent (DSA) and a Write-Your-Own (WYO) Program for the NFIP
* DSA is private contractor for FEMA
* WYO is written privately, but with 100% government reinsurance and reimburses administration expenses

Name three types of premium subsidies built into the NFIP rating structure
* Pre-FIRM subsidy (house built 1974 or earlier or when first FIRM map published)
* Newly Mapped Subsidy (mapped after 4/1/2015)
* Grandfathering Cross-Subsidy (if your community is remapped you can still pay at original rate)
* Community Rating System (For communities that mitigate flood risk)
