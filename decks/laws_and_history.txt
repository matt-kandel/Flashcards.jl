* Insurance regulation falls to the states

Describe US vs. South-Eastern Underwriters Association (SEUA)
* In 1944, states were beginning to repeal their antitrust laws
* The SEUA was colluding to control 90% of fire & allied lines market
* Fixing premium rates and agents' commissions
* SEUA used boycotts, coercion, and intimidation on their competitors and consumers
* Supreme Court said that insurance is interstate commmerce and therefore subject to federal law (especially Sherman Antitrust)

Briefly describe the history of federal antitrust law and how it applies to insurance
* Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 does not apply to insurance (still state level under Paul vs. Virginia)

* McCarran-Ferguson Act essentially gave the insurance industry what they wanted
* Federal government can still enforce ntitrust stuff (Boycott, coercion, intimidation) under Sherman Act
* If Congress passes a law specifically for the insurance industry, it supercedes state laws

Describe the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the circumstances of its enactment
* Affiliation between banks (federally regulated) and insurers (state regulated) caused confusion
* Banks can't sell insurance, and also can't create subsidiaries to sell insurance
* Banks can use financial holding companies to create insurer affiliates, so it's hard for them to use insurer assets to meet operational needs
* Banks also need to disclose information-sharing policies to mitigate the consumer privacy risk
* Prompted NAIC Producer Model Act to standardize licensing and standards across states, and ensure rates were not "inadequate, excessive, or discriminatory"
